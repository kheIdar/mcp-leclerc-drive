# mcp-leclerc-drive

> An open-source **MCP server for E.Leclerc Drive** — let an MCP-capable assistant search products, compare value, manage a cart, and prepare grocery orders natively instead of clicking through the website.

> 🟢 **v0.3 — working & DataDome-proof.** All eight tools are validated end-to-end against the live site. Requests run inside a **real Chrome driven over CDP**, so they pass DataDome's bot protection (which blocks headless clients and cookie-replay). You log into Leclerc Drive once in the window that opens; the session persists. See [`docs/api-capture.md`](docs/api-capture.md) for the reverse-engineered API.

## Why

E.Leclerc Drive has no public API. Today the only way to automate it is browser automation — slow (~3–5 s per item) and fragile (blind clicks). This project exposes the underlying operations as proper MCP tools so any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) can drive it directly.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `find_stores(query)` | Find drives near a postal code or city → name, id, service type, distance, host. |
| `set_store(store_id)` | Select & remember the active store (resolves the right host automatically). |
| `get_store()` | Show the currently selected store. |
| `search_product(query)` | Search the catalogue → products with price, price/kg, Nutri-Score, availability, and an `id`. |
| `search_best_product(...)` | Rank matching products by relevance, effective price, price/kg or L, promotions, requested quantity/format, and optional preferred brands. |
| `add_to_cart(product_id, quantity?)` | Add a product to the cart. |
| `remove_from_cart(product_id)` | Remove a line from the cart. |
| `update_quantity(product_id, quantity)` | Set a line's quantity (0 removes it). |
| `get_cart()` | Read the full cart with total. |

## Smart product selection in this fork

This fork adds a deterministic `search_best_product` tool so an assistant does
**not** blindly add the first Leclerc search result.

The default `balanced` strategy:

- filters out unavailable and weakly matching products;
- uses promotional prices when they are genuinely lower than the regular price;
- compares both total ticket price and price per kg/L when available;
- can use a requested quantity such as `2 L` or `750 g` to estimate how many
  packs are needed and penalize unnecessary overbuying;
- can mildly favor preferred brands without allowing a large price gap to be
  ignored.

Two explicit alternatives are available: `cheapest` (minimize checkout cost)
and `unit_price` (prioritize price per kg/L).

The ranking tool only recommends products. Cart mutation still goes through
`add_to_cart`, which keeps selection and write actions separate and auditable.

## Status

- [x] Reverse-engineer Leclerc Drive endpoints (search / cart / store locator — see [`docs/api-capture.md`](docs/api-capture.md))
- [x] All 8 tools validated end-to-end against the live store
- [x] Runtime store selection with persistence (`find_stores` / `set_store`)
- [x] **v0.3: DataDome-proof via real-Chrome CDP driving** (beats active bot-challenge that killed cookie-replay) ✅
- [x] Published to npm + MCP registry
- [ ] Checkout / delivery-slot booking

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 22** (uses the built-in `WebSocket`)
- **Google Chrome** installed (the server drives it via CDP)

## Install (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kheIdar/mcp-leclerc-drive.git
cd mcp-leclerc-drive
git checkout feature/smart-product-selection
npm install
npm run build
npm run test:ranking
```

## How auth works (real Chrome via CDP)

Leclerc Drive is protected by [DataDome](https://datadome.co/), which blocks
non-browser traffic (headless clients, cookie-replay) with HTTP 403 once it
escalates to active challenge mode. The only thing that reliably passes is a
**real browser** that executes the challenge. So that's what the server uses:

1. On first request it launches **your installed Google Chrome** with a
   dedicated, persistent profile (`~/.mcp-leclerc-drive/chrome`) and a debug
   port — **no automation flags**, so `navigator.webdriver` stays `false`.
2. A Chrome window opens. **Log into Leclerc Drive once** in it. The persistent
   profile keeps you logged in across restarts.
3. Every request runs *inside* that page via CDP, so it carries the browser's
   cookies, TLS fingerprint, and solved DataDome challenge — and passes.

No cookies are read or stored; there's no Keychain prompt. The server must run
on the same machine as Chrome, and a window does open (headless is detectable by
DataDome — don't enable it unless you know the risk).

| Env var | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LECLERC_STORE_ID` | `053701` | Default store id (overridden at runtime by `set_store`). |
| `LECLERC_HOST` | `fd9-courses.leclercdrive.fr` | Default backend host (the `fdN` prefix varies by store). |
| `LECLERC_CHROME_PATH` | auto | Path to the Chrome binary, if not in the default location. |
| `LECLERC_CHROME_PROFILE_DIR` | `~/.mcp-leclerc-drive/chrome` | Persistent Chrome profile dir. |
| `LECLERC_CHROME_PORT` | `9222` | CDP remote-debugging port. |
| `LECLERC_HEADLESS` | `false` | Run Chrome headless (⚠️ DataDome-detectable — not recommended). |
| `LECLERC_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Minimum delay between two requests (hygiene). |
| `LECLERC_JITTER_MS` | `400` | Extra random jitter added between requests. |
| `LECLERC_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retries on a transient 403/429 before giving up. |
| `LECLERC_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` | `1500` | Base retry backoff (doubles each attempt). |

The server still serializes and spaces out requests (single queue, ~1 s + jitter,
retry with backoff) to stay polite — good hygiene even though the browser now
handles DataDome.

### Choosing your store (no env needed)

The easiest way: just **ask, in the conversation**. No env vars required.

```
> "trouve mon drive vers 44000"     → find_stores lists nearby drives
> "prends Rezé Atout Sud"           → set_store remembers it (correct host resolved)
> "cherche du lait"                  → runs on that store
```

`set_store` persists your choice to `~/.mcp-leclerc-drive/config.json`, so it
sticks across sessions, and it resolves the correct backend host for you (the
`fdN` prefix genuinely varies per store — `fd8`, `fd9`, `fd14`…).

> ⚠️ **One drive at a time.** Leclerc binds your session to a single drive. The
> store you `set_store` to must be the one your Chrome session is logged into —
> which is the normal case (your own drive). Switching to an arbitrary other
> drive your browser isn't on will return a "session expired" error.

You can still hard-set the store via `LECLERC_STORE_ID` / `LECLERC_HOST` env vars
if you prefer (e.g. for headless deploys). To find them manually: your Drive URL
looks like `https://fd9-courses.leclercdrive.fr/magasin-053701-053701-Your-Town/`
— the 6-digit number is the store id, the `fdN-courses.leclercdrive.fr` part is
the host.

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code (`mcp` config)

Install straight from npm — no clone needed:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add leclerc-drive -- npx -y mcp-leclerc-drive
```

Or in a Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "leclerc-drive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-leclerc-drive"]
    }
  }
}
```

No env needed — pick your store in-conversation with `find_stores` / `set_store`.
On first use a Chrome window opens: log into Leclerc Drive once and you're set.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # tsc --watch
